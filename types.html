          Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disorder that begins after a traumatic event. That event may involve a real or perceived threat of injury or death. The condition may last months or years, with triggers that can bring back memories of the trauma accompanied by intense emotional and physical reactions. The trauma could be anything like an accident, natural disaster - earthquake/tornado, military combat, physical/sexual assault or abuse.
        </div>

        <div class="lessons">
          The symptoms may include nightmares or flashbacks, avoidance of situations that bring back the trauma or depressed mood.
