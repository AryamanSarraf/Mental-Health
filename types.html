        </div>

        <div class="lessons">
          Treatment is usually medication, talk therapy or a combination of the two. Increasingly, research suggests that these treatments may normalize brain changes associated with depression.

        <div class="lesson-title">

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Genetics</span> - Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder.
